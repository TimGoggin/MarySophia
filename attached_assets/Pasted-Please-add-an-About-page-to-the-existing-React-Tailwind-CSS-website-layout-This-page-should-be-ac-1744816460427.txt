Please add an About page to the existing React + Tailwind CSS website layout. This page should be accessible by clicking the “About” link in the header navigation and routed using React Router.

🔁 Routing
Use React Router (v6 or newer) to route the "About" link to /about.

Ensure the navigation link highlights as active when on this route (if applicable).

📄 About Page Layout
Use a full-width responsive layout.

Content should be inside a centered container (max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-16).

Background should be white or soft gray to maintain calm, spiritual aesthetics.

🔷 Section Structure:
1. Page Header
Main title: “About Mary Sophia”

Subtitle or tagline: “Teacher of the Way of Mary, devoted to the Divine Feminine”

2. Introductory Paragraph
One to two short paragraphs describing Mary Sophia’s spiritual mission and calling, written in first or third person:

Mary Sophia is a spiritual teacher who channels the wisdom of Mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and the Angelic Realm. She serves as a guide for others to connect with their original divine essence and live with heart-centered clarity.

3. Image Section
Include a portrait image (placeholder is fine) aligned right or centered on mobile.

Optionally use a rounded frame or subtle border shadow for elegance.

4. Philosophy or Core Beliefs Section
Use bullet points or stylized cards to highlight key themes, e.g.:

Embodiment of Divine Feminine Wisdom

Heart-led spiritual transformation

Sacred mentorship and community guidance

5. Call to Action (Optional)
Invite users to explore other areas of the site:

“Discover the School of Mary” or “Join the Order of the Blue Rose”

💅 Styling
Use Tailwind utility classes.

Ensure elegant spacing, soft borders, large typography for headlines.

Responsive on all devices.

✅ Extras
Add a <title> or <Helmet> tag: About | Mary Sophia

Animate sections with soft fade-in or slide-up on scroll (optional).

The goal is to create a page that feels deeply personal, peaceful, and spiritually resonant with the rest of the site’s theme.
