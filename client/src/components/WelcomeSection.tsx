          As a teacher of the Way of Mary and a follower of Christ, I serve as a
          channel for the divine wisdom of Mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and the
          Angelic Realm. My mission is to help others remember their Original
          Essence and embody the Wisdom of the Heart. Through the Order of the
          Blue Rose, we work to awaken and nurture the divine feminine wisdom
          that resides within each of us. This sacred work combines ancient
          spiritual teachings with direct guidance from the divine realms. I am
          dedicated to supporting individuals on their journey of spiritual
          awakening, helping them connect with their divine nature and live
          their Original Blessing on Earth.
