                    Spiritual counseling is a heart-centered approach that
                    supports your soul's journey toward wholeness and alignment
                    with your True Nature. Unlike traditional therapy, which
                    often focuses on mental and emotional aspects, spiritual
                    counseling integrates the spiritual dimension, helping you
                    connect with your inner wisdom and the Divine Feminine
                    presence within.

                    Each session is a sacred space tailored to your unique
                    needs. We may engage in channeled guidance, intuitive
                    healing, spiritual counseling, or explore ancient wisdom
                    traditions. The intention is always to support your return
                    to remembrance, helping you embody your true essence and
                    live as the Heart of God on Earth.

                    If your heart resonates with the teachings of the Divine
                    Feminine, the wisdom of Sophia, or the sacred lineage of the
                    Blue Rose, you may feel an inner calling. This path is about
                    remembering and embodying your divine essence. If you feel
                    drawn to this work, trust that inner knowing — it's a sign
                    that your soul is ready to awaken.
